# Example Inputs
volatilities <- c(0.5, 0.3, 0.4)         # Volatilities of each stock
weights <- c(0.4, 0.3, 0.3)              # Weights of each stock (must sum to 1)

# Correlations between each unique pair of stocks
# For three stocks, we need three correlations: (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3)
correlations <- c(0.2, -0.1, 0.3)        # Example correlations for pairs (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)

# Calculate and print portfolio volatility
portfolio_volatility <- calculate_portfolio_volatility_multistock(volatilities, weights, correlations)
