# Define changes in market returns
market_up <- x       # Market increases by x%
market_down <- x    # Market decreases by x%

# Define changes in stock returns corresponding to market movements
stock_up <- x       # Stock increases by x% when market goes up
stock_down <- x    # Stock decreases by x% when market goes down

# Calculate the difference in stock return and market return
delta_stock <- stock_up - stock_down
delta_market <- market_up - market_down

# Calculate Beta
beta <- delta_stock / delta_market

# Display the result
